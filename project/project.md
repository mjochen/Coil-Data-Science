# The Project

In this course, you can choose to complete a project. This means you will need to find a dataset (as open data, from an API, or by scraping it from a website), load it, clean it, and analyse it. In the end, you will give a presentation on the difficulties you encountered and what you learned from working with this dataset.

## Technical content

Because participants in this course have varying levels of Python knowledge, there are no strict rules regarding the complexity of the code in your final submission. Use this as an opportunity to experiment and explore how far your programming skills can take you.

This flexibility applies especially to data acquisition. If you have little or no previous Python experience, performing a full web scrape with Selenium will be out of reach; in that case, using an existing open CSV file is recommended. If you do have more experience, feel free to build a larger and more elaborate dataset.

For the next parts, however, you are required to use NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas in the way they are covered in the classes.

## Teams

Form groups of up to 4 people. These can be international groups or groups from your own institution. You may also work in a smaller team or complete the project on your own.

Only one GitHub repository is required per group. This may be public or private. If it is private, invite "mjochen" as a github colaborator.

## Follow-up

If you choose to do the project, inform the instructor by email. Include the names and email addresses of all group members, and the GitHub repository you will use.

You are required to upload the required components by the start of next week's class.

## Required parts

### 1. Regex and scraping

Upload the dataset to GitHub (if possible) and include a document describing where you found the data. If you scraped it or used an API, include the code as well.

### 2. NumPy and Matplotlib

Upload one or more Jupyter notebooks in which you load the data with NumPy, clean it, and create graphs showing the distribution of the variables.

### 3. Pandas

Upload one or more Jupyter notebooks in which you load the data with Pandas, formulate a hypothesis, and prove or disprove it using graphs.

### 4. Presentation

To properly finish the project, create and deliver a presentation about your data. You will present during the last class. Not all group members are required to speak. The presentation may last up to 10 minutes, followed by time for questions from other students.
