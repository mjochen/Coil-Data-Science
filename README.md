# Coil Data Science

The course material for the COIL on Data Science, organised by Thomas More.

## Timing

* Session 1: 19 February 
* Session 2: 26 February 
* Session 3: 5 March 
* Session 4: 19 March

Classes are from 16h00 to 18h00 CET (UTC+1). 

## Pre-flight

Complete the following exercises: [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/python/Warmup-2) and email me (in reply to this email) a screenshot of all completed exercises (the login screen with all green checkboxes) before the start of the next session.

If the codingbat-exercises are very difficult for you, do mention that in your email. The whole point of these exercises is checking the level of all students participating in this course, so copying the solutions or asking an AI to make them for you won’t get you a better grade but will make the rest of the course exponentially more difficult.

## Sessions

* Session 1: Regex and scraping
* Session 2: Numpy and Matplotlib
* Session 3: Pandas
* Session 4: Roundup and presentations
